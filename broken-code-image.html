        This abstract image was born from an error in the code I created to process the words of Shakespeare's <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong>. What began as a programmatic mistake turned into something unexpected yet beautiful. By analyzing the error and capturing it visually, I’ve transformed a broken process into a work of art. The words of the poem are no longer readable, yet they live on in a new form—abstract and open to interpretation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The juxtaposition of logic and chaos in this image represents the fragility and unpredictability of computational art, where even errors can lead to creativity. The essence of <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong> is still embedded within the chaos of the code, but it’s now abstracted, detached, and reinterpreted. The act of processing the poetic text into something computational inherently alters it, turning something classical and structured into something chaotic yet organic. This mirrors the eternal conflict between structure and randomness, control and chaos, logic and emotion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some ways, this image could be seen as a visual metaphor for the tragic nature of <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong> itself. The story is one of love and fate, where logic and reason break down amidst powerful emotions and uncontrollable events. Similarly, this image represents the breakdown of a structured process, where a seemingly small error leads to something unexpected and possibly even more meaningful than the intended outcome.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The code that led to this abstract image symbolizes the intersection between technology and the humanities, where the language of computers and the language of Shakespeare meet. The result is an unexpected fusion, something that transcends both forms. Here, the words of a timeless play are remade into something that, while not immediately comprehensible, is still beautiful in its own right. It challenges the viewer to see art and literature in a new way—through the lens of code and digital creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This artwork is a celebration of the unexpected beauty that can emerge from errors, the way something imperfect can lead to creativity. In the world of art and programming, sometimes it’s the mistakes that reveal the most interesting results. I hope this piece invites you to reflect on how errors can be as meaningful as success, and how every broken part of a process can be reimagined into something new and unique.
