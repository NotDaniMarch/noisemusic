    <p>Electronic music is a broad genre that encompasses a wide range of styles and techniques, characterized by the use of electronic devices and technology to create sound. Emerging in the mid-20th century, it has evolved from experimental compositions to mainstream hits, shaping the landscape of modern music. A significant aspect of its development has been the influence of <a href="noise-music.html">noise music</a>, which challenged traditional notions of sound and paved the way for innovative sonic exploration.</p>

    <p>Noise music, with its emphasis on dissonance, unconventional sound sources, and the embrace of chaos, laid the groundwork for many electronic music practices. Early electronic composers, inspired by the works of figures like John Cage and Luigi Russolo, began to incorporate the principles of noise into their own compositions. The manipulation of sound through synthesizers, tape machines, and other electronic instruments allowed artists to explore the textures and timbres of noise in new and exciting ways.</p>

    <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, pioneers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Schaeffer experimented with musique concrète and synthesized sounds, further merging the realms of noise and electronic music. This period saw the rise of avant-garde movements that embraced the raw, unfiltered qualities of sound, pushing listeners to rethink their relationship with music.</p>

    <p>As electronic music evolved, genres like industrial, techno, and ambient incorporated elements of noise, resulting in diverse soundscapes that challenge conventional musical structures. Artists such as Throbbing Gristle and Aphex Twin utilized harsh noise, distortion, and glitch techniques, blending them with rhythmic elements to create immersive auditory experiences.</p>

    <p>Today, the influence of noise music on electronic music can be heard across a multitude of styles, from experimental sound art to mainstream pop. The exploration of texture, unconventional rhythms, and the integration of found sounds are all hallmarks of this cross-pollination. Noise music has not only enriched electronic music but has also expanded the possibilities of what music can be, inviting listeners to embrace the beauty found in chaos and experimentation.</p>
