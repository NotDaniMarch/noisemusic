    <p><strong>Noise music</strong> is a genre that fundamentally challenges traditional notions of melody, harmony, and rhythm. Embracing dissonance, chaos, and unconventional sound, noise music redefines the role of sound in art, creating experiences that are both immersive and transformative. The genre’s origins can be traced back to the early 20th century, when avant-garde composers like <a href="john-cage.html">John Cage</a> and <a href="luigi-russolo.html">Luigi Russolo</a> boldly pushed the boundaries of what could be considered musical.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>John Cage, known for his innovative compositions and philosophical approach to sound, believed that noise music could be a profound form of artistic expression. His embrace of silence and randomness in compositions challenged traditional music structures. Similarly, Luigi Russolo, a futurist, argued in his groundbreaking 1913 manifesto The Art of Noises that noise music should be seen as an extension of the musical form, incorporating industrial and mechanical sounds as vital elements.</p>

      <p><em>“I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of the old ones.”</em></p>
      <p><strong>— John Cage</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This quote encapsulates the essence of noise music and its ongoing challenge to established norms in both art and sound. By rejecting melody and harmony, noise music fosters a deeper exploration of sound as a medium, often incorporating an array of unconventional instruments and everyday objects to create immersive auditory experiences.</p>

    <p>At its core, noise music seeks to break down the barriers between music and noise, using feedback, distortion, and electronic manipulation. This unique form of musical expression evokes raw emotion and invites listeners to reconsider their relationship with sound. It’s a genre that transcends traditional musical categories, inviting experimentation and spontaneity.</p>

  <section>
    <p>The legacy of Luigi Russolo and John Cage continues to inspire experimental artists in the world of noise music. Their philosophies shape the genre’s underground scene, where performers explore new auditory territories and confront the boundaries of sound. Today, noise music influences a variety of genres — from <a href="electronic-music.html">electronic music</a> and <a href="noise-rock.html">noise rock</a> to avant-garde <a href="classical-music.html">classical music</a> — proving the lasting impact of Russolo and Cage on contemporary sound art.</p>

  <section>
    <p>The performances within the world of noise music can range from chaotic and confrontational to meditative and immersive. Whether it’s through the manipulation of mechanical sounds or the use of synthesizers and experimental instruments, noise music provides an environment where listeners are invited to experience the sound in its rawest, most unfiltered form. John Cage's and Luigi Russolo’s philosophies of embracing chance and the unpredictability of sound have become foundational to modern noise music.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Ultimately, noise music is more than just a genre; it’s a way of thinking about and interacting with the world of sound. The raw, unprocessed elements of noise music encourage listeners to explore new dimensions of auditory experience, celebrating the beauty found in chaos and the unexpected. Through the work of composers like John Cage and Luigi Russolo, noise music has evolved into a powerful artistic force, continuously challenging and reshaping how we perceive sound.</p>
